# concrete_section_analysis

This is a project which is used to calculate the bending moment of a regular or irregular symmetrical concrete section.

For regular section, you can run main.py and use gui to input parameters to analysis its bending moment, its failure type and mechanic diagram.

For irregular section, you should read the readme.md and create json through following the rules in it. After that, you can upload the json file in gui interface and analysis it easily.
